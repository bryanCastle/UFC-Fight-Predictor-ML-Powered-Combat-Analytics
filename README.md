## üìä Project Overview

This project transforms a tennis prediction workflow into a comprehensive UFC fight outcome prediction system. The core innovation is the adaptation of the ELO rating system for mixed martial arts, incorporating fighter-specific attributes, recent form, and matchup dynamics.

### Problem Framing
- **Binary Classification**: Fighter A wins vs. Fighter B wins
- **Output**: Win probability + class label for selected fighter
- **Domain**: UFC/MMA fight outcomes with temporal awareness

### Data Architecture
- **Unit of Analysis**: One row per scheduled fight
- **Target Variable**: Official bout winner (Red/Blue corner)
- **Features**: Fighter attributes, recent form, matchup deltas, ELO ratings
- **Time Awareness**: Chronological ordering prevents future information leakage

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Assembly & Preprocessing
```python
# Key preprocessing steps
- Chronological sorting of all fights
- Missing value imputation and data cleaning
- Fighter ID mapping and name standardization
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Data type conversion and validation
```

### 2. ELO Rating System Implementation
**Core ELO Formula:**
```
Expected Win Probability = 1 / (1 + 10^(-(ELO_A - ELO_B)/400))
Rating Update = K * (Actual Outcome - Expected Outcome)
```

**9 ELO Features Implemented:**
- Base ELO ratings (overall skill)
- Weight class-specific ELO ratings
- ELO gradient tracking (trend analysis)
- Head-to-head records (overall and weight class specific)
- Rolling statistics for last K fights
- ELO decay for inactive fighters
- Recent form-weighted ELO
- Surface/venue-neutral ELO
- Opponent quality-adjusted ELO

### 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline
**Matchup Deltas:**
- Age differences, height/reach advantages
- Stance matchups, layoff days
- Ranking differences, camp changes
- Physical attribute comparisons

**Form & Schedule Features:**
- Rolling win rates (3/5/10 fight windows)
- Opponent quality-adjusted metrics
- Recent performance trends
- Fight frequency analysis

**Style Proxies:**
- Striking pace and accuracy
- Takedown success/defense rates
- Control time metrics
- Submission and KO tendencies

### 4. Model Development Pipeline
**Baseline Models:**
- Simple heuristics (pick higher ELO)
- Decision Tree (interpretability focus)
- Random Forest (bagging ensemble)
- XGBoost (boosting comparison)

**Training Protocol:**
- Chronological train/test split
- Minimal scaling (tree-based models)
- Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV
- Strict leakage controls

**Model Selection:**
- Random Forest achieved best stability
- 99.59% internal accuracy
- Robust feature importance analysis
- Excellent probability calibration

## üîç Data Leakage Prevention

### Strict Controls Implemented
1. **Chronological Ordering**: All features computed using only past information
2. **Post-Fight Stats Removal**: No fight-specific statistics used as features
3. **ELO Updates**: Ratings updated strictly after each fight
4. **Rolling Windows**: All rolling statistics use only prior fights
5. **Time-Based Splitting**: Train/test split respects temporal boundaries

### Validation Checks
- No duplicate or mirrored rows across train/test
- No target-encoding columns (result, method, post-fight totals)
- ELO/rolling stats computed with prior bouts only
- Test split is future relative to train
